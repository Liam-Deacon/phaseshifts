Overview
========

The EEASiSSS program is characterized by three features:

i. Muffin-tin radii :math:`r_{MT}` and charge content :math:`q_{MT}` per 
   MT sphere are calculated inside the program without any exterior 
   start values.

ii. The inner potential is spatially flat. It gets an energy variation due to 
    the use of Kohn-Sham and Hedin-Lundqvist local density approximation to the 
    exchange-correlation interaction of incident-electron and crystal electron 
    gas [1]_ [2]_ . In consequence :math:`r_{MT}` and :math:`q_{MT}` show 
    weak energy variations.

iii. Coulomb potential and electron density are generated by superposition of 
     free-atom potentials (default) or extracted from WIEN2k's FLAPW 
     program packet by means of an ASA routine [3]_ . FLAPW is full-potential 
     linearized augmented plane wave; ASA is atomic sphere approximation.

WIEN2k is a licensed program packet and the ASA routine is WIEN2k property. 
Public use of ASA requires that the routine be acknowledged by the WIEN2k team.

The variation of the inner potential versus incident energy puts a particular 
programming condition on the LEED program applying EEASiSSS. Calculated phase 
shifts, describing electron scattering inside the crystal, are referred to the
in-crystal energy: 

.. math::

    E_{cryst} = E_{inc} - V_0(E_{inc})
    
Where :math:`E_{inc}` is the incident energy.

EEASiSSS provides an interstitial energy file :math:`V_0(E)` to be read-in by 
the LEED program. A selection math:`V_0` = const is provided for LEED programs 
not equipped with :math:`E_{cryst}` code.

K. Heinz et al. have shown by LEED experiment that the use of :math:`V_0(E)`
resolves structural parameters with precision 0.01 Angstroms [4]_ . Selection 
:math:`V_0(E)` was the winner in an accuracy competition between various 
phase shift methods arranged by V.B. Nascimento et al. in a LEED investigation 
on the (001) surface of calcium strontium ruthenate [5]_ . Recently 
:math:`V_0(E)` has been used in several complex LEED cases, for instance, 
magnetite [6]_ and polyaromatic trithiolate adsorbed on Cu(111) [7]_ .

The input data to an EEASiSSS calculation are illustrated by an input template 
on the GaAs(110)-(1x1) surface slab structure [8]_ .

.. _eeasisss_calculation:

EEASiSSS calculation
====================

The EEASiSSS package performs the calculation of the phase shifts in two steps:

1. The atomic charge densities of each element in the model is calculated 
   using the Hartree-Fock method by the `hf.py`_ program using a variant of Eric Shirley's 
   :code:`hartfock()` subroutine.
2. The phase shifts are then calculated from the generated charge density files and 
   an EEASiSSS input file describing the model geometry and calculation parameters. 

Although these steps are taken care of automatically through the :code:`phsh` script, 
two utility programs - `hf.py`_ and `eeasisss.py`_, respectively - are installed as 
part of the phaseshifts package.

.. _eeasisss_hf:

:code:`hf.py`
-------------

A Python command line script is installed as part of the phaseshifts
package which can be used to calculate atomic charge densities 
for different elements. 

Syntax
++++++

The command line calling convention for the `hf.py`_ program is::

    hf.py -i <input> [-a <chgden_dir> -o <log_file>]

The options are described below:

:code:`-i <input>`
    Specifies the path to the atomic orbital input file. Default is './InputA'.

:code:`-a <chgden_dir>`
    Optional argument which specifies the output directory to place the calculated 
    atomic charge density :code:`chgden*` files into. If no argument is given, the 
    :code:`ATLIB` environment variable is used as the output directory, else 
    '~/atlib' path is used. Use '.' for :code:`<chgden_dir>` to place the output files 
    into the current working directory.

:code:`-o <log_file>`
    Optionally redirects the calculation log to the file specified by :code:`<log_file>`.  
    The default is to print to :code:`stdout` if the argument is omitted.
    
.. note::
    The `hf.py`_ script should be installed on the system :code:`PATH` 
    and therefore executing the program using the absolute file path should 
    not be needed.

An example input file can be found under `examples/EEASiSSS/GaAs/inputA` and 
covers the format of the atomic orbital input file.

The charge density output files for each element in the form: :code:`chgden<symbol>`

:code:`eeasisss.py`
-------------------

Syntax
++++++

The `eeasisss.py`_ Python script can be called using the following syntax:: 

    eeasisss.py -i <input> [-o <output_dir> -a <chgden_dir> -l <log_file>]

The command line options for calling the program are:

:code:`-i <input>`
    Specifies the path to the EEASiSSS model input file. A complete 
    description of the format is given below. Default is './inputX'.

:code:`-l <log_file>`
    Name of log file. Default is :code:`stdout` if :code:`-l` argument 
    is not specified.
    
:code:`-o <output_dir>`
    path to log file, phase shifts, and  selected intermediate files.
    Default is './result/'.
    
:code:`-a <chgden_dir>`
    path to charge density files and to intermediate electrostatic 
    MT charge file(s). Default, in order, is :code:`ATLIB` environment variable,
    then the path given by '~/atlib/'.

Comments on example input file
------------------------------

STRUCTURE Section
+++++++++++++++++

**Line 1:** Title of the surface structure; output files are named by the title 
following the designation convention of WIEN2k.

**Line 2:** Active with WIEN2k, path to charge-density and potential data.

**Line 3:** Factor defining length in Bohr units inside the program; 
it is 1.889726 when unit cell and atomic positions are given in Angstroms. 
Energy units inside are Rydbergs.

**Line 4-6:** Unit cell basis vectors **a** :sub:`1`, 
**a** :sub:`2` and **a** :sub:`3`, respectively, in Angstroms.

**Line 7:** :code:`nieq` = number of inequivalent atoms.

**Line 8:** contains eight items, which are ordered as follows:

1. :code:`neq` = number of equivalent atoms (= 1 in the template);
2. :code:`Z` = atomic number (i.e. 31 for Ga, 33 for As);
3. identification number of atom, consecutive i=1,nieq.
4. When selection :code:`Vcoul=='S'`: 4th item not used, can be set to zero;
   When selection :code:`Vcoul=='W'`: identification number in WIEN2k calculation,
   i.e. the integer of a WIEN2k permutation with value i=1,nieq.
5. :math:`r_{MT}^{min}` = minimum :math:`r_{MT}` used in MT radius 
   optimization; default = :code:`0` in the template corresponds to 0.5 
   Bohr inside.
6. :math:`r_{MT}^{max}` = maximum :math:`r_{MT}` in muffin-tin 
   radius optimization; default = :code:`0` in the template corresponds to a 
   value set by the charge density input.
7. core level shift of atomic potential in eV.
8. print this particular phase shift? :code:`'yes'/'no'`.

.. note:: Items 5, 6 and 7 are beta quantities that were provided for computer 
          experiments with EEASiSSS.

**Line 9:** Atomic positions x,y,z of which x,y are parallel to surface plane 
and z increases with depth below surface. When :code:`neq` on line 8 is > 1, 
line 9 is replaced by :code:`neq` lines of atomic positions.

OPTIONS Section
+++++++++++++++

**Line 1:** :code:`VCoul` which can be either:
 * :code:`'S'` for Free Atom Superposition
 * :code:`'W'` for WIEN2k.
 
With :code:`'S'` atomic electron density and Coulomb potential are generated by 
superposition of free-atom charge densities. 
Selection :code:`'W'`, extracts the charge densities from a WIEN2k calculation.

**Line 2:** :code:`Vxc` which can be either:
 * :code:`'E'` for Energy Dependent :math:`V_0(E)`  
 * :code:`'C'` for constant :math:`V_0`.
 
With :code:`'E'` the exchange-correlation potential :math:`V_0(E)` is 
calculated from Kohn-Sham theory via the Hedin-Lundqvist local density 
approximation; see figure README.V0vsE.ps. 
With :code:`'C'` the inner potential is put equal to :math:`V_0(E)`, 
:math:`E`=60 eV, although the phase shifts were calculated with 
energy :code:`E` variable.

**Line 3:** :code:`VMadl`  - a flag for whether the Madelung potential is used
and can be either code:`'yes'/'no'`.
Selection code:`'n'` corresponds to current LEED. 
Selection :code:`'y'` generates the Madelung (electrostatic) potential at 
a particular atom from the infinite collection of neighboring atoms. 

The literature on electrostatic potentials is incomplete for LEED 
investigations; required is a theory for semi-crystals z > 0 and for various 
distributions of top-layer charges. 

In EEASiSSS an improvised surface description is used, cf. comments in 
subroutine :code:`ProcRoySoc_ElectrostaticPotential`. 
Selection :code:`VMadl='y'` requires that selection :code:`VMadl='n'` 
has been executed beforehand to produce charge content per MT 
sphere :math:`q_{MT}(E)`.

**Line 4:** :code:`MTrad` has three options: 
 * :code:`'D' = DEopt`
 * :code:`'M' = MidptNNdist` 
 * :code:`'I' = IntersecNNpot`.
 
Selection :code:`'D'` is recommended: Differential Evolution method determines MT 
spheres from three conditions: that non-overlapping MT spheres are as large as 
possible; that MT potentials are continuous to a flat inner potential; and that 
all MT potentials are energy-shifted by the same amount.
 
Old-fashioned selections :code:`'M'` and :code:`'I'` are at 
user's service: :code:`'M'` sizes MT spheres approximately to 
halve next-neighbour distance, and :code:`'I'` searches 
points on atom-to-atom lines where the next-neighbour potentials intersect.

**Line 5:** :code:`SpinPS` option to  print SpinPhaseShift? :code:`'yes'/no'`.
With :code:`'y'` files are printed using designations .su. and .sd. for 
spin up and down, respectively. Relativistic spin-less phase shifts labelled 
.sl. are calculated from .su. and .sd. as linear averages with weights 
:math:`\frac{l+1}{2l+1}` and :math:`\frac{l}{2l+1}`, respectively 
(:math:`l=0,1,2,...`).

**Line 12:** Energy grid.
The present program version uses a uniform energy grid of mesh 2 eV. By 
uncommenting lines in subroutine EnergyGrid one can create non-uniform grids 
getting gradually sparser at energies above a convenient limit, say, 80 eV.

**Line 14:** Selection of :math:`r_{MT}^{weight}` .

Two errors are calculated, :math:`r_{err} = rms(g_{NN})` and 
:math:`v_{err} = rms(V_{stp})`, from two concurrent quantities
:math:`g_{NN}(:)`  = gap between next-neighbor MT spheres (in Bohr),
:math:`V_{stp}(:)` = discontinuity of potential at :math:`r_{MT}` (in eV),
where (:) symbolizes set of atoms, :math:`V_{tot}` is total potential of 
MT sphere, and :math:`V_0` is interstitial potential. Using rMTweight the errors 
are weighted together to a single fitness value guiding the optimization 
by the Differential Evolution method.

.. math::

  fitness = \sqrt{(r_{MT}^{weight} \times r_{err}^2) + (1 - r_{MT}^{weight})v_{err}^2}
  
where :math:`0 < r_{MT}^{weight} < 1`

It is noted that fitness combines quantities of different units of 
measurement. The mix of units seems meaningful when :math:`v_{err}` and 
:math:`r_{err}` harmonize with the resolution of a LEED investigation in terms 
of voltage and interatomic distance.

**Line 15:** accuracy (in eV) of zeroth order potential continuity at MT sphere 
radius. Physically available and acceptable values of accuracy 
and :math:`r_{MT}^{weight}` are studied in the log file.

DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION METHOD Section

Selection of parameters from reference:
R. Storn and K. V. Price, J. Global Optimization 11, 341-59 (1997); 
http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html.

:code:`NPfac` and :code:`itermax` have high or low values when the number 
of atoms is high or low; fitness and number of iterations are 
inspected in the EEASiSSS log.
