As with all scientific progress, we stand on the shoulders of giants. If this
package is of use to you in publishing papers then please acknowledge the
following people who have made this package a reality:

 - **A. Barbieri** and **M.A. Van Hove** - who developed most of the original
   fortran code. Use *A. Barbieri and M.A. Van Hove, private communication.*
   (see ``doc/phsh2007.txt`` for further details).

 - **E.L. Shirley** - who developed part of the fortran code during work towards his
   PhD thesis (refer to the thesis: *E.L. Shirley, "Quasiparticle calculations in
   atoms and many-body core-valence partitioning", University of Illinois, Urbana, 1991*).

 - **J. Rundgren** - who developed the EEASiSSS package and collaborated on 
   numerous improvements to the underlying FORTRAN code base. Please cite
   *J. Rundgren, Phys. Rev. B 68 125405 (2003).*

 - **Christoph Gohlke** - who developed the elements.py module used extensively throughout
   for the modelling convenience functions (see 'elements.py' for license details).

I would also be grateful if you acknowledge this python package (*phaseshifts*) as:

I wish to personally add a heartfelt thanks to both Eric Shirley and Michel Van Hove
who have kindly allowed the use of their code in the ``libphsh.f`` file needed for the
underlying low-level functions in this package.
