Alternatives
------------

A number of alternatives are available, notably the following:

1. `AQuaLEED <https://physics.mff.cuni.cz/kfpp/povrchy/software>`_ (with a useful
   `poster overview of phaseshifts calculations <https://physics.mff.cuni.cz/kfpp/povrchy/files/1179-Poster.pdf>`_).
   This is an officially mentioned piece of software on Michel Van Hove's
   `LEEDPACK webpage <https://www.icts.hkbu.edu.hk/VanHove_files/leed/leedpack.html>`_,
   however when tested as of January 2024 the link appears to be dead (with a ``500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR``).
   Furthermore, although the poster mentions that the software is written in python,
   this software is not (currently) distributed on https://PyPI.org and therefore harder to
   intergrate with other python LEED-related projects such as `CLEED <https://github.com/Liam-Deacon/CLEED>`_
   and `cleedpy <https://github.com/empa-scientific-it/cleedpy>`_.

.. note:: Should you know of alternatives, please either
          `open an issue <https://Liam-Deacon/phaseshifts/issues>`_ or
          (better yet) create a PR with changes to this documentation
          to keep this list up to date.
