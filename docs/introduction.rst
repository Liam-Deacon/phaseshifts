Introduction
************

This package is a Python package which produces atomic phase shifts for
various LEED packages (including CLEED), as well as for certain XPD packages.

Currently, it uses the Barbieri/Van Hove phase shift calculation package and
preliminary support for John Rundgren's EEASiSSS package as backends. The
Fortran components are exposed via the legacy f2py path or the modern
scikit-build-core/CMake build (used for Python 3.12+), with Python wrappers
providing a user-friendly object-orientated interface for the end user.

The aim of this package is to both automate and simplify the generation of
phase shift files in a manner that is easy for the computational hitch-hiker,
but powerful for those that wish to extend the package for particular needs.

The :ref:`phsh` script unifies many of the steps needed for the phase
shift calculations into a single command intended for the end-user. For more
information please read the documentation at

Barbieri/Van Hove backend
-------------------------

The original phase shift package developed by A. Barbieri & M. A. Van Hove
during the 1970's & 1980's. To quote the authors' site:

"The phase shift calculation is performed in several steps:

1. Calculation of the radial charge density for a free atom.

2. Calculation of the radial muffin-tin potential for atoms embedded in a
   surface defined by the user (the surface is represented by a slab that
   is periodically repeated in 3 dimensions, within vacuum between the
   repeated slabs); various approximations to the exchange potential
   are available; relativistic effects are taken into account.

3. Calculation of phase shifts from the muffin-tin potential.

4. Elimination of pi-jumps in the energy dependence of the phase shifts."

EEASiSSS backend
----------------

The EEASiSSS package [#]_ [#]_ [#]_ can also calculate phase shifts and has been used
in several works on oxides from the mid-2000s to early-2010s [#]_ [#]_. In the
words of the package's
author, John Rundgren, the main qualifications of the program are:

+ The program accepts three sources of atomic potentials:

    1. E. L. Shirley's atomic program [#]_ applied together with Mattheiss's
    superposition method.

    2. The DFT-SCF program of V. Eyert using the full-potential
    Augmented Spherical Wave method [#]_ .

    3. The DFT-SCF program `WIEN2k <http://www.wien2k.at/>`_ using the
    full-potential Augmented Plane Wave method.

+ The exchange-correlation interaction between the scattered electron and the
  crystal's electron gas generates an energy-dependent inner potential.
  The phase shifts are referred to the in-crystal kinetic energy, and it is
  supposed that an associated LEED code uses the same standard.
+ The crystal potential is everywhere continuous so as to exclude fortuitous
  standing-wave electron resonances in the muffin-tin spheres and pertaining
  fortuitous wobblings in the phase shift versus energy curves.
+ The optimization of the muffin-tin radii is made using the method of
  `Differential Evolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution>`_
  , an extremely efficient minimizer.
